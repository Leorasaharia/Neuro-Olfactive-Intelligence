# Perfume Response Analysis using Agentic AI architecture

### Neuro-Olfactive Intelligence for AI-Driven Luxury Fragrance Design

---

## 📘 Project Overview

**Perfume Response Analysis** is an applied AI and data science project that explores the relationship between **odorant materials, neural responses (EEG wave changes), and associated cognitive or emotional states**.

The objective is to demonstrate how **data-driven neuro-olfactive insights** can support the creation of **personalized, sustainable, and inclusive luxury fragrance experiences**, aligned with the **L’Oréal Brandstorm 2026 mission**.

This project serves as a **proof-of-concept intelligence layer** for **ScentEvolve** — an AI-powered, biotech-enhanced fragrance ecosystem designed for global deployment under L’Oréal Luxe brands.

---

## 🎯 Strategic Purpose (Brandstorm Context)

Luxury fragrance consumers increasingly seek:

* Emotional resonance and identity expression
* Personalized discovery journeys
* Ethical, sustainable, and transparent innovation

Simultaneously, the rise of **fragrance dupes** highlights unmet needs in **education, experimentation, and confidence-building prior to purchase**.

This project demonstrates how **AI-assisted scent intelligence** can:

* Enable informed fragrance discovery
* Reduce blind purchases and waste
* Preserve creative integrity while expanding access
* Accelerate conversion into authentic luxury products

### Dataset Contents

The dataset compiles scientific observations linking:

* Odorant materials
* EEG wave changes (alpha, beta, theta, delta, gamma)
* Corresponding brain functions (attention, relaxation, alertness, emotional response)

**Columns:**

* `Odorant Materials`
* `EEG Wave Changes`
* `Brain Functions`
* `Reference`

The dataset is licensed under **CC0 (Public Domain)** and is suitable for:

* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Neuroscience-informed AI modeling

---

## 🛠 Technical Approach

### 1. Feature Engineering

* Combined **odorant descriptors + EEG response text**
* NLP-based vectorization using **TF-IDF**
* Encoded cognitive/emotional brain states as classification targets

### 2. Machine Learning Models

* **Logistic Regression** (baseline, interpretable)
* **XGBoost** (non-linear, high-performance)
* **TensorFlow Neural Network** (scalable deep learning architecture)

### 3. Explainability & Ethics

* **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** used to interpret model decisions
* Ensures transparency, auditability, and responsible AI usage

## 🤖 Jury-Safe Explanation of Agentic AI

This project **does not implement autonomous or self-directing AI agents**.

Instead, *agentic AI* is used in a **controlled, assistive sense**, defined as:

> A decision-support system that dynamically adapts recommendations based on human-provided inputs, biological signals, and contextual data — without autonomous decision-making or behavioral manipulation.

**Key safeguards:**

* Human-in-the-loop design
* No psychological profiling for persuasion
* No biometric storage or inference without consent
* AI outputs remain **recommendations**, not decisions

The system **supports** human creativity, consumer understanding, and product design — it does not replace or override human judgment.

## 🧪 Integration with L’Oréal Technology Ecosystem

This project conceptually integrates with L’Oréal’s existing and future capabilities:

### 🔬 Osmobloom™ (Biotech Extraction)

* Neuro-olfactive insights guide **selection of emotional accords**
* Precision scent design reduces reformulation waste
* Aligns with sustainable extraction and ingredient innovation

### 💄 ModiFace (AR & AI Experience)

* Predicted emotional states can power **AR fragrance storytelling**
* Enables immersive, personalized discovery journeys online and in-store

### ⌚ Wearables & Biometrics (Future-ready, optional)

* HRV / GSR signals (opt-in) can refine mood-based recommendations
* Supports inclusive personalization without reliance on demographics

---

## 🌱 Sustainability & Inclusivity Impact

### Sustainability

* Reduces blind buying and product waste
* Supports modular and refill-based fragrance systems
* Optimizes formulation cycles using data-driven insights

### Inclusivity

* Emotion- and response-based personalization (not gendered or cultural stereotypes)
* Scalable across regions (West, China, Asia-Pacific)
* Accessible discovery model without compromising luxury positioning

---

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (Illustrative)

* Accuracy of mood / cognitive-state prediction
* Reduction in product return rates
* Increase in discovery-to-purchase conversion
* Refill adoption and repeat engagement
* Consumer engagement time in discovery journey
